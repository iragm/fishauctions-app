# Backend Spec — Web-Configurable Printing, Push Notifications, AR Lot Mapping & Offline Sync

Handoff spec for `iragm/fishauctions` (the Django backend). The Flutter app work is
tracked separately in this repo; this document is everything the *backend* needs so
the app can be a dumb interpreter and all product behavior lives on the web.

Design principle for both features: **changes to the website ship in minutes,
changes to the app take dev time.** Anything that could plausibly vary per
printer, per deployment, or per product decision is a Django model instance or a
template — never an app constant.
